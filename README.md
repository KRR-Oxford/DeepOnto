  A package for ontology engineering with deep learning. 
</p>

## About <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

DeepOnto aims to provide implemented deep learning models and an evaluation platform for various ontology engineering purposes. 

> Documentation: https://krr-oxford.github.io/DeepOnto/#/.

> Github Repository: https://github.com/KRR-Oxford/DeepOnto.

## Essential Dependencies

DeepOnto is mainly extended from the following packages:

- [OwlReady2](https://owlready2.readthedocs.io/) for basic ontology processing.
- [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) for pre-trained language models.

## Implemented Models

| Name                 | Task                            | Type              |
| :-------------       | :---------------                | :--------------   |
| BERTMap              | Ontology Matching (Equivalence) | Learning-based    |
| StringMatch          | Ontology Matching (Equivalence) | Rule-based        |
| EditSimiarity        | Ontology Matching (Equivalence) | Rule-based        |
| BERTSubs (not ready) | Ontology Matching (Subsumption) | Learning-based    |

> See https://krr-oxford.github.io/DeepOnto/#/intro for quick usage.
