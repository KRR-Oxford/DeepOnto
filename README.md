  A package for ontology engineering with deep learning. 
</p>

## About <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

DeepOnto aims to provide implemented deep learning models and an evaluation platform for various ontology engineering purposes. 

- **Documentation**: *https://krr-oxford.github.io/DeepOnto/#/*.
- **Github Repository**: *https://github.com/KRR-Oxford/DeepOnto*. 
- **PyPI**: *https://pypi.org/project/deeponto/*. (experimental)

To use DeepOnto scripts, it is sufficient to git the project and run the scripts directly; to build on a new project extending DeepOnto, please install DeepOnto from PyPI by:

```bash
pip install deeponto
```

## Essential Dependencies

DeepOnto is mainly extended from the following packages:

- [OwlReady2](https://owlready2.readthedocs.io/) for basic ontology processing.
- [OWLAPI](http://owlapi.sourceforge.net/) (in Java) for advanced ontology processing. The Python-Java interaction relies on what has been implemented in [mOWL](https://mowl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) which uses [JPype](https://jpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
- [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) for pre-trained language models.

To use DeepOnto, please manually configure Pytorch installation using:

```bash
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch
```

Then, install other dependencies in [`requirement.txt`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KRR-Oxford/DeepOnto/main/requirements.txt):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
