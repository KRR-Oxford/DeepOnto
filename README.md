  A package for ontology engineering with deep learning. 
</p>

## News :newspaper:

- **[2023 Jan]** Rebuild $\textsf{DeepOnto}$ based on the OWLAPI and remove owlready2 from the essential dependencies.


## About

$\textsf{DeepOnto}$ aims to provide tools for implementing deep learning models, constructing resources, and conducting evaluation
for various ontology engineering purposes.

- **Documentation**: *<https://krr-oxford.github.io/DeepOnto/>*.
- **Github Repository**: *<https://github.com/KRR-Oxford/DeepOnto>*. 
- **PyPI**: *<https://pypi.org/project/deeponto/>* (will be updated after major update). 

## Installation

### OWLAPI

$\textsf{DeepOnto}$ relies on [OWLAPI](http://owlapi.sourceforge.net/) version 4 (written in Java) for ontologies. 

We use what has been implemented in [mOWL](https://mowl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) that uses [JPype](https://jpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to bridge Python and Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

### Pytorch

$\textsf{DeepOnto}$ relies on [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) for deep learning framework.

Configure Pytorch installation with CUDA support using, for example:

```bash
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116
```

Basic usage of Ontology does not rely on GPUs, but for efficient deep learning model training, please make sure
`torch.cuda.is_available()` returns `True`.

### Install from PyPI

Other dependencies are specified in `setup.cfg` and `requirements.txt` which are supposed to be installed along with `deeponto`.

```bash
pip install deeponto
```

### Use Git Repository

One can git clone the repository without installing through PyPI and install the dependencies manually by:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Main Features

### Extending the OWLAPI

$\textsf{DeepOnto}$ extends the OWLAPI library for ontology processing and reasoning, and also for better integration with deep learning modules. 
The base classes that extend the OWLAPI functionalities are [`Ontology`][deeponto.onto.Ontology] and [`OntologyReasoner`][deeponto.onto.OntologyReasoner]. Examples of how to use them can be found [here](pages/ontology).

### BERTMap

*BERTMap* [1] is a BERT-based *ontology matching* (OM) system originally developed in [repo](https://github.com/KRR-Oxford/BERTMap) but is now maintained in $\textsf{DeepOnto}$. See how to use BERTMap in this [tutorial](pages/bertmap).

### OM Evaluation

$\textsf{DeepOnto}$ provides an evaluation workaround for OM systems including *global matching* and *local ranking* as proposed in [here](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-19433-7_33) [2]. See how to use this evaluation framework in this [tutorial](pages/om_eval).

### Bio-ML

*Bio-ML* [2] is an OM resource and has been integrated into the [Bio-ML track of the OAEI](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/isg/projects/ConCur/oaei/). See [instructions](pages/om_resources) of how to use Bio-ML.
