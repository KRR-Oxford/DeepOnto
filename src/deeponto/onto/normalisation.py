class OntologyNormaliser:
    r"""Class for ontology normalisation.

    !!! note "Credit"

        The code of this class originates from the [mOWL library](https://mowl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html),
        which utilises the normalisation functionality from the Java library `Jcel`.

    The normalisation process transforms ontology axioms into **normal forms** in the Description Logic $\mathcal{EL}$, including:

    - $C \sqsubseteq D$
    - $C \sqcap C' \sqsubseteq D$
    - $C \sqsubseteq \exists r.D$
    - $\exists r.C \sqsubseteq D$

    where $C$ and $C'$ can be named concepts or $\top$, $D$ is a named concept or $\bot$, $r$ is a role (property).



    Attributes:
        onto (Ontology): The input ontology to be normalised.
        temp_super_class_index (Dict[OWLCLassExpression, OWLClass]): A dictionary in the form of `{complex_sub_class: temp_super_class}`, which means
            `temp_super_class` is created during the normalisation of a complex subsumption axiom that has `complex_sub_class` as the sub-class.
