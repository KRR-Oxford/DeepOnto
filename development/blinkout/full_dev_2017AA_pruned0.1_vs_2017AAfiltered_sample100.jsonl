We recently reported that some Tyrphostin AG-related compounds inhibited the H2O2 - induced activation of TRPM2 by scavenging the intracellular hydroxyl radical. In the present study, we examined the effects of AG-related compounds on H2O2 - induced cellular responses in human monocytic U937 cells, which functionally express TRPM2. The effects of AG-related compounds on H2O2 - induced changes in intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation, and CXCL8 secretion were assessed using U937 cells. Ca(2+) influxes via TRPM2 in response to H2O2 were blocked by AG-related compounds. AG-related compounds also inhibited the H2O2 - induced activation of ERK, and subsequent secretion of CXCL8 mediated by TRPM2 - dependent and - independent mechanisms. Our results show that AG-related compounds inhibit H2O2 - induced CXCL8 secretion", "label_id": 536, "label": "Conceptually broad term referring primarily to physical illness.
