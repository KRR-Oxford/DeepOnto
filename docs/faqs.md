# FAQs :question:

- Q1: Encountering issues with the JPype installation?
    - Ans: JPype seems to be not compatible with the most recent version of Python; for stability reasons, use Python 3.8 instead. Also, please ensure that the essential dev tools package has been deployed if you are using a Linux system.

- Q2: Windows compatibility?
    - Ans: In the previous releases, the OWLAPI integration only worked on Mac OS and Linux.
    The system restriction should be lifted now, please make a query if the incompatibility still exists.
